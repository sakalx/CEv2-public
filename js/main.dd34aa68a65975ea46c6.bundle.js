What is this?",answer:"This is your Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as known as an ESPP. It’s an opportunity for you to buy a piece of your company at a nice discount. Think of it an exclusive employees-only sale on your company’s stock. Nice, right? Fun fact: only 30% of publicly-traded companies offer this program. Today’s your lucky day! "},{id:"contribution-2",question:"2. How much money can I set aside to buy discounted stocks?",answer:"You can set aside up to 15% of your total paycheck (before deductions) every six months."},{id:"contribution-3",question:"3. What’s the minimum I can contribute?",answer:"You can set aside as little as 1% of your paycheck and we’ll cover the rest to help you buy the maximum amount of stock available to you at a discount. We do this by lending to you the difference between what you decide to set aside and 15% of your paycheck."},{id:"contribution-4",question:"4. What is my discount?",answer:"Good question. You’ll be able to buy stock at 15% discount off the lower of the starting or the ending price over the course of six months. That means you could get much more than a 15% discount!"},{id:"contribution-5",question:"5. Wait, how does this work?",answer:"Your company offers its employees discounted stock twice a year. There’s just one condition: you can only buy discounted shares with money that you’ve set aside from your paycheck during the six months leading up to the sale plus the loan amount. \n  \n        As soon as you own the shares, their value will be the market price even though you purchased them at a steep discount. That’s your Employee Stock Purchase Plan in a nutshell.\n        \n        The best part? We’ll provide an interest-free loan to help you purchase as much discounted stock as you are allowed. So, if the market price of the shares is $100, we will lend you $85 per share up to your allowable max.  Once you buy the shares, you only give us back $85, leaving you $15 richer for every share you buy using our interest-free loan. This is a brand-new feature to help you get the most from your employer’s stock plan."},{id:"contribution-6",question:"6. So, why should I do this?",answer:"Have you ever heard the expression “Buy low, sell high?” Well, when you buy shares from your company at a discount, you’re always buying low. And, because you are buying shares at a discount, you capture the value of the discount immediately. Your Employee Stock Purchase Plan could be one of the best ways for you to get extra value from your company.\n  \n        The stock market is a dynamic market where prices for shares may go up or down daily.  When you buy shares, even in your company, there is no guarantee whatsoever that those shares once purchased will keep their value.  It is very important that you consult your investment adviser with respect to the consequences of investing in the stock market."},{id:"contribution-7",question:"7. When can I sign up?",answer:"You have to sign up for your plan at least seven days before a new six-month period starts. If you miss this deadline, you can always sign up for the next one."}],summary:[{id:"summary-1",question:"1. What are the benefits of maximizing my contribution?",answer:"Simply put, the more money you put in, the greater the opportunity to capture the value of the discount. What you do afterward with the shares is up to you.  You can keep them as an investment or sell them and convert the value of the discount into immediate cash."},{id:"summary-2",question:"2. Can I sell my shares right away?",answer:"Yes! You can sell your shares as soon as you buy them, instantly turning your discount relative to the market price into extra cash with no strings attached. Or, you can hold onto your shares and let them grow."},{id:"summary-3",question:"3. Can I end my plan before the purchase date?",answer:"Yes, you can leave your plan at any time, as long as it is at least 10 days before the share purchase date. If you decide to leave, you’ll get all the money you’ve set aside back (but without interest).\n  \n        If you change your mind and want back in, you can always sign up again, but you’ll have to wait for the next enrollment phase."},{id:"summary-4",question:"4. Why should I use an interest-free loan to buy shares? Is there a risk to me?",answer:"Here’s the short answer: \n  \n        An interest-free loan could help you make more money on your company’s discounted shares without any additional risk. \n        \n        Here’s the slightly longer answer with only a little bit of math: \n        \n        To use our example above, you have the chance to buy a share with a market value of $100 for $85. For each share you buy, you immediately gain $15 in value. Now, let’s say you borrow $85 to buy more shares. You sell enough shares (valued at $100) to pay back the loan and you keep the extra $15 of value. \n        \n        By maximizing your contribution, you can get the most benefit from your discounted stock options every time."}],agreement:[{id:"agreement-1",question:"1. Does it make more sense to sell at the highest price available?",answer:"Our goal is to help you get the most value from your employee stock purchase plan. The great thing about it is that you get to choose the plan that works best for you.\n  \n      We like to make the most of each investment by selling as high as possible. If you feel that setting a different price would work better for you, we’re happy to help you do that, too. It’s your plan, after all!"},{id:"agreement-2",question:"2. What are the benefits of setting a custom sale price to pay off my loan?",answer:"Setting a custom price for selling your shares is one way that you can tailor your plan to fit your unique needs. If you have a particular price in mind, this option lets you choose. At the end of the day, your plan is all about helping you achieve your financial goals for your investments."}],completed:[{id:"completed-1",question:"1. Enroll process completed, agreement signed.",answer:"Write some explanation about what next about company etc"}],closed:[{id:"closed-1",question:"1. Can I change my monthly contribution later?",answer:"You have one chance to change your monthly contribution provided that it is not (25) days before the day on which the shares will be sold to you."},{id:"closed-2",question:"2. Can I end my plan before the purchase date?",answer:"Yes, you can leave your plan at any time, as long as it is at least 10 days before the sale. If you decide to leave, you’ll get all the money you’ve set aside back.\n  \n        If you change your mind and want back in, you can always sign up again for the next sale."},{id:"closed-3",question:"3. What happens if I leave my company?",answer:"If you leave your company, all of the money you set aside will be returned to you. You’ll be missed!"},{id:"closed-4",question:"4.  I think I made a mistake. Can I start over?",answer:"Of course! You can return to any section by clicking the timeline up top, or you can restart your entire enrollment by clicking the company logo."}]}};function Y(e,t){var
